        <h5>Hey <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span></h5>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
        <p>I'm a Product Manager that loves to code; currently working at Microsoft!</p>
        <p>I graduated from Texas A&M University in May of 2023 where I received a Bachelor of Science in Multidiscipliary Engineering with a concentration in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>
        In college, I explored various mediums of creation like music production, podcasts, and video editing. After reading the Almanack of Naval Ravikant and learning about his philosophy of permissionless leverage, I learned to code. A month after reading that book, I created a website that reached over 150k users in more than 100 countries. Now, I seek the leverage he talks about.
