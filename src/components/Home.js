        Pre-college, I explored various mediums of creation like music production, podcasts, and video editing. After reading the Almanack of Naval Ravikant and learning about his philosophy of permissionless leverage, I was inspired to code. A month after reading that book, I created a website that reached over 200k users; now I seek the leverage he talks about.
